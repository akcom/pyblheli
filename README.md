# PyBLHeli

PyBLHeli is a cross-platform tool which allows you to edit BLHeli hex files
without using the windows GUI.  The only requirement is a unix-like environment
and python 2.7.x.  Simply run python pyblheli.py and you're off.  Help is
provided via the 'help' command.  Go figure!

for usage of the BLHeliHex class, check out the example()
function in blhelihex.py
